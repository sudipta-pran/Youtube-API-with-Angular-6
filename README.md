## About this project

I built this to help one of my former students with his college degree project. It uses Angular 6 front-end framework to implement the youtube API('https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/'). You'll need to create a Google API key and give it permission to access youtube API. This is a very simple project which can also be implemented using html and vanilla javascript/jQuery. I found some difficulty to implement an iframe for the videos, maybe the src attributes needs to be sanitized. I myself is very new to Angular. If someone can help implement iframes for the videos I would really appreciate that. As of now, the thumbnails are displayed and a link is provided as href to the videos.
